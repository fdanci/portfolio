                Hello I'm Florin, a college graduate looking for a job.
                I graduated È˜tefan cel Mare University of Suceava, Computer science field, Bachelor's degree.
                My main focus and interest for now is becoming a professional in the area of software development.
                Right now I am learning more about APIs and servers. I would love an opportunity where I could gain
                more knowledge around these concepts.

                I like challenges and learning new things constantly.
                During my free time I like to read or listen audiobooks. Occasionally, I draw and play computer
                games. I also love exercising frequently. I think it helps the body and the mind and it's awesome
                to feel and look good.
