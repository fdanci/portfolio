                I like to draw now and then for some reason. I remember even in kindergarten, most kids could barely
                draw stick men and I
                could draw 3D shapes or objects (cars, houses, people, fingers, hands). I didn't invest much time on
                this aspect
                because I think that unless you're an absolute genius or you're good at drawing and even better at
                selling your
                stuff
                you can't get a lot of value from your drawings. Despite this, I still draw sometimes, is is
                fulfilling in some way and you can impress the people at the party, from time to time.
